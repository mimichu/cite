I am a second-year robotics master student at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon Univeristy, where I work as a member of the [Robots Perceiving and Doing Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/) Lab with [Prof David Held](https://davheld.github.io/).
I am interested in developing systems that enable robots to perform dynamic, complex manipulation tasks by learning to extract task-relevant semantic visual cues efficiently from limited demonstrations. 
Currently, I work on develping self-supervised learning-based perception-focused system to robustly perform various manipulation tasks, such as mug hanging, peg-and-hole insertion.

Previously I completed my BS in Robotics (Honours), in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) at University of Toronto. There, I worked on deep natural language processing with [Prof Frank Rudzicz](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/) at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I also worked on microfludics with [Prof Eugenia Kumacheva](https://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/chemistry/staff/EK/about.html) during early exposure to research.

<!-- I also intered as a software engineer at the FPGA division (now Network and Custom Logic Group) at Intel for a year as part of the Professional Experience Year program during my undergrad. -->
